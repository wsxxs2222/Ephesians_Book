audio to text content (google colab)

ppt to title
ppt to image
restore punctuation for sentences
combine content sentences to text block
match title with content
title and content to latex

todo:
auto create latex folder for each lecture, auto paste the vscode configuration folder into the directory so the tex file is compiled using XeLatex.
fix the bug that some titles are missing when combining title and content to latex. The title object file does not miss the titles.

improvement:
improve title and content matching algorithm. Replace word similarity with semantic similarity.
preserve the original punctuations or add new punctuations after content matching.
let each line contain only 1-2 sentences (max of 2 sentences or ? characters).
record common mis-classified words and create a map to map them to correct words. (same step as restore punctuation)
